# Simple Programming <img src="https://github.com/Gingervitis5/Simple-Programming/blob/main/Simple Programming.png" width="75">
This project is an idea I created back at the beginning of my Senior Project class at EWU. Simple Programming is a programming language aimed to teach kids at a middle school level to learn how to program syntactically. Most beginner programming consists of either literal blocks of code or don't include very much syntax. While Scratch is an amazing tool, it lacks the syntax that most, if not all, programming has. This language aims to fulfill that role of introducing younger students to programming syntax.
